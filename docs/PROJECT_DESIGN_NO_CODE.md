# Modular Trading System: Design & Architecture (No Code)

This document provides a comprehensive, language-agnostic blueprint for a modular trading system. It covers system design, module responsibilities, logic flows, extensibility, and best practices—**without any code, file names, or implementation-specific details**. Use this as a foundation to implement the system in any language or tech stack.

---

## 1. System Overview

- **Purpose:**
  - Automated trading strategy execution
  - Real-time market data processing
  - Position and risk management
  - Monitoring and alerting
- **Key Features:**
  - Pluggable strategies
  - Real-time and historical data handling
  - Robust risk controls
  - Multi-channel notifications
  - Extensible, testable, and observable architecture

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

- **Modular, service-oriented design**: Each major feature is encapsulated in its own module/service.
- **Event-driven communication**: Modules interact via events/messages for decoupling and extensibility.
- **Separation of concerns**: Business logic, data access, middleware, and UI are separated.
- **Plug-in ready**: Strategies, data sources, and notification channels can be added/replaced independently.
- **Testable and observable**: All modules are designed for unit/integration testing and real-time monitoring.

- **Logic Flow:**
  1. On data fetch, check cache (L1 → L2 → L3)
  2. If hit, return cached data
  3. If miss, fetch from source, cache result
  4. Invalidate as needed
- **Extensibility:** Add new cache backends or custom invalidation.

### Market Data Integration

- **Purpose:** Ingest, normalize, and broadcast real-time/historical market data.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Connect to external APIs/websockets
  - Normalize and validate incoming data
  - Emit events for new data
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. Connect to data provider(s)
  2. Receive raw data
  3. Normalize/validate
  4. Emit events to subscribers
- **Extensibility:** Add new data sources or normalization logic.

### Strategy Engine

- **Purpose:** Load, configure, and execute trading strategies.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Discover/load strategies (plug-in architecture)
  - Execute strategy logic on new data
  - Emit trade signals
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. On new market data, run all enabled strategies
  2. Each strategy analyzes data, may emit trade signals
  3. Dispatch signals to risk/order management
- **Extensibility:** Plug-in for custom strategies, support for multiple strategy types.

### Order Management

- **Purpose:** Place and track orders, update positions, calculate P&L.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Receive trade signals
  - Place orders via broker/exchange APIs
  - Track order status, update positions
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. On trade signal, check risk
  2. If approved, place order
  3. Track order status (fill, cancel, reject)
  4. Update positions and P&L
- **Extensibility:** Support for multiple brokers/exchanges, advanced order types.

### Risk Management

- **Purpose:** Enforce risk rules, perform risk checks, generate alerts.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Evaluate all trades/positions against risk rules
  - Block or alert on violations
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. On trade signal or position update, evaluate risk
  2. Approve/deny or trigger alert
  3. Monitor ongoing risk metrics
- **Extensibility:** Add new risk rules or alerting logic.

### Notification System

- **Purpose:** Notify users/operators of key events.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Send notifications via multiple channels
  - Support templated messages
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. On event, format message using template
  2. Send via configured channels
  3. Track delivery status
- **Extensibility:** Add new notification channels or templates.

### Monitoring & Logging

- **Purpose:** Track system health, performance, and errors.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Centralized, structured logging
  - Real-time metrics and health checks
  - Error and performance monitoring
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. All modules log actions/events/errors
  2. Metrics are collected and exposed for dashboards/alerting
  3. Health checks run periodically
- **Extensibility:** Integrate with external monitoring/alerting systems.

### API Layer (Optional)

- **Purpose:** Expose endpoints for external integration.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Handle authentication, rate limiting, input validation

### User Interface (Optional)

- **Purpose:** Provide dashboards for monitoring, control, analytics.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Display real-time updates for positions, P&L, system status
  - Allow user control of strategies and config

## 4. End-to-End Logic Flow

1. **Startup:** Load config, initialize all modules, authenticate with external APIs, start background jobs.
2. **Market Data Event:** Data arrives → normalized → cached → sent to strategy engine.
3. **Strategy Execution:** Strategies process data → may emit trade signals.
4. **Order Flow:** Trade signal checked by risk management → if approved, order placed → order status tracked, positions updated, P&L recalculated.
5. **Risk & Notification:** Risk management monitors all trades/positions, alerts/notifications sent on risk events or errors.
6. **Monitoring:** All actions/errors logged, metrics and health endpoints exposed for dashboards.
7. **Shutdown:** Graceful shutdown, persist state, notify users.

## 5. Example Data Flows & Event Chains

- Market Data → Strategy Engine → Trade Signal → Risk Management → Order Management → Position Update
- User/API Request → Auth → Service → Response
- System Event → Notification System → User/Operator

## 6. Extensibility & Best Practices

- **Plug-in Architecture:** Add/replace strategies, data sources, notification channels without changing core logic.

- **Event-Driven Design:** Use events for decoupling modules and enabling flexible workflows.
- **Strict Typing/Interfaces:** Define clear contracts for all module boundaries.
