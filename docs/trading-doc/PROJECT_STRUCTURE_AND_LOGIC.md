# Project Structure and Logic Flow

## Overview

This document describes the architecture, module responsibilities, and logic flow of a modular, service-oriented trading bot platform. It is designed to be language-agnostic and can be used as a blueprint for implementation in any programming language.

---

## 1. **Core Architectural Principles**

- **Modular Design:** Each major feature is encapsulated in its own module or service.
- **Service-Oriented:** Business logic is separated into services, which interact via well-defined interfaces.
- **Middleware:** Cross-cutting concerns (e.g., error handling, caching, security) are handled by middleware components.
- **Extensibility:** New features can be added as new services or middleware without modifying core logic.
- **Testability:** All modules are designed for easy unit and integration testing.

## 2. **Major Modules and Responsibilities**

### **A. Authentication & Session Management**

- Handles user authentication (e.g., OAuth, API keys).
- Manages user sessions and token refresh logic.
- Provides hooks for multi-factor authentication.

### **B. Configuration Management**

- Loads and validates configuration from environment variables and config files.
- Supports runtime configuration reloads.

### **C. Database Layer**

- Abstracts all database operations (CRUD for users, trades, positions, etc.).
- Provides connection pooling and transaction management.
- Supports migrations and schema evolution.

### **D. Caching Layer**

- Multi-level cache (in-memory, distributed, persistent).
- Tag-based and TTL-based invalidation.
- Used for market data, session tokens, and computed analytics.

### **E. Market Data Integration**

- Connects to external APIs for real-time and historical market data.
- Normalizes and validates incoming data.
- Emits events for new ticks/candles.

### **F. Strategy Engine**

- Loads and manages trading strategies (plug-in architecture).
- Executes strategies on new market data.
- Generates trade signals based on strategy logic.

### **G. Order Management**

- Receives trade signals and places orders via broker/exchange APIs.
- Tracks order status and handles retries/cancellations.
- Updates positions and P&L.

### **H. Risk Management**

- Enforces risk rules (max drawdown, position sizing, stop loss, etc.).
- Performs pre-trade and post-trade risk checks.
- Generates alerts for risk violations.

### **I. Notification System**

- Sends notifications via email, SMS, chat, or webhooks.
- Supports templated messages and multi-channel delivery.

### **J. Monitoring & Logging**

- Centralized logging with structured logs.
- Real-time metrics and health checks.
- Error and performance monitoring.

### **K. API Layer (Optional)**

- Exposes REST/gRPC/WebSocket endpoints for external integration.
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.

### **L. User Interface (Optional)**

- Terminal or web dashboard for monitoring, control, and analytics.
- Real-time updates for positions, P&L, and system status.

## 3. **Logic Flow (High-Level)**

1. **Startup:**

   - Load configuration and initialize all services (DB, cache, logger, etc.).
   - Authenticate with external APIs (e.g., broker, data provider).
   - Start background jobs (data polling, health checks).

2. **Market Data Handling:**

   - Receive real-time or historical data.
   - Normalize and validate data.
   - Emit events to strategy engine and cache.

3. **Strategy Execution:**

   - On new data, run all enabled strategies.
   - Each strategy analyzes data and may emit trade signals.

4. **Order Lifecycle:**

   - Risk management checks each signal.
   - If approved, order management places the order.
   - Track order status, update positions, and recalculate P&L.

5. **Risk & Compliance:**

   - Continuously monitor positions and trades for risk violations.
   - Trigger alerts and auto-close positions if needed.

6. **Notification & Monitoring:**

   - Send notifications for key events (trade executed, risk breach, error).
   - Log all actions and errors.
   - Expose metrics and health endpoints for monitoring.

7. **Shutdown:**
   - Gracefully close connections and persist state.
   - Notify users and log shutdown reason.

---

## 4. **Extensibility & Best Practices**

- **Plug-in architecture** for strategies, data sources, and notification channels.
- **Dependency injection** for testability and modularity.
- **Strict typing/interfaces** for all module boundaries.
- **Comprehensive tests** for all modules (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- **Documentation** for all public APIs and extension points.

## 5. **Example Data Flow (Pseudocode)**

```
[Market Data] → [Strategy Engine] → [Trade Signal] → [Risk Management] → [Order Management] → [Position Update]
         ↓                ↓                ↓                ↓                ↓
   [Cache]         [Logger]         [Notifier]        [DB]           [Monitoring]
```

---

## 6. **Deployment & Operations**

- Containerized deployment (e.g., Docker).
- Environment-based configuration (dev, staging, prod).
- Automated migrations and health checks.
- Scalable horizontally (stateless services, distributed cache).

## 7. **Summary**

This architecture enables a robust, extensible, and maintainable trading system. By following this structure and logic flow, you can implement the project in any language or tech stack, adapting each module to the tools and libraries best suited for your environment.
