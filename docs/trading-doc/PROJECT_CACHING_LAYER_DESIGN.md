# Caching Layer Design & Best Practices for Modular Trading System

This document provides a robust, language-agnostic blueprint for the caching layer of a modular trading system. It covers caching goals, recommended architecture, core concepts, best practices, security, monitoring, and extensibilityâ€”**without code or implementation details**. Use this as a guide for designing a reliable, scalable, and maintainable caching layer in any tech stack.

## 1. Caching Goals & Benefits

- **Reduce latency:** Serve frequently accessed data quickly to improve system responsiveness.
- **Decrease load:** Offload repeated queries from the database and external APIs.
- **Increase throughput:** Enable higher request rates by reducing bottlenecks.
- **Improve resilience:** Provide fallback data during transient backend outages.
- **Enable real-time analytics:** Cache computed metrics for dashboards and monitoring.

## 2. Recommended Architecture: Multi-Level Caching

- **L1: In-Memory Cache (Process-local)**
  - Fastest access, limited to the current process (e.g., Node.js memory, `node-cache`).
  - Used for ultra-frequent, small data (e.g., session tokens, recent market ticks).
- **L2: Distributed Cache (e.g., Redis)**
  - Shared across all application instances.
  - Supports clustering, pub/sub, and persistence.
  - Used for cross-process/session data (e.g., user sessions, market data, analytics).
- **L3: Persistent/Database Cache (Optional)**
  - Use the main database as a fallback for rarely changing or large data.
  - Used for historical data, cold storage, or as a last-resort cache.

## 3. Core Concepts

- **Cache Keys:**
  - Unique identifiers for each cached item (e.g., `user:123:session`, `market:NIFTY:2024-07-23`).
  - Use consistent, descriptive key naming conventions.
- **Tags:**
  - Group related cache entries for bulk invalidation (e.g., all data for a symbol or user).
- **TTL (Time-to-Live):**
  - Set expiration for each cache entry based on data volatility (e.g., 1s for ticks, 1h for configs).
- **Invalidation:**
  - Remove or update cache entries when underlying data changes (on write, on schedule, or via pub/sub events).
- **Cache Miss/Hit:**
  - On miss, fetch from source, cache result; on hit, serve from cache.
- **Consistency:**
  - Choose between strong consistency (write-through, read-through) and eventual consistency (write-back, async updates) based on use case.

## 4. Data Types to Cache

- **Market Data:**
  - Real-time ticks, OHLCV candles, recent trades.
- **Session Tokens:**
  - User authentication/session data for fast validation.
- **Analytics & Metrics:**
  - Computed statistics, risk metrics, dashboard data.
- **Configuration:**
  - Feature flags, strategy parameters, rarely changing settings.
- **API Responses:**
  - Results from slow or rate-limited external APIs.
- **Other:**
  - Any data that is expensive to compute or fetch and is accessed frequently.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Consistency & Reliability

- **Appropriate TTLs:**
  - Set TTLs based on data volatility and business requirements.
- **Bulk Invalidation:**
  - Use tags or patterns to invalidate groups of related cache entries efficiently.
- **Fallbacks:**
  - Always have a fallback to the source of truth (DB or API) on cache miss or error.
- **Atomic Operations:**
  - Use atomic cache operations (e.g., Redis transactions) for multi-step updates.
- **Cache Warming:**
  - Pre-populate cache with critical data at startup or on schedule.
- **Graceful Degradation:**
  - Design the system to handle cache outages without catastrophic failure.

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data:**
  - Avoid caching sensitive information unless encrypted and access-controlled.
- **Access Control:**
  - Restrict access to distributed cache (e.g., Redis) to trusted networks/services.
- **Expiration:**
  - Ensure session tokens and credentials expire promptly in cache.
- **Audit Logging:**
  - Log cache access and invalidation events for auditability.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Metrics

- **Cache Hit/Miss Rates:**
  - Track and alert on hit/miss ratios to optimize cache effectiveness.
- **Evictions & Expirations:**
  - Monitor how often items are evicted or expire.
- **Latency:**
  - Measure cache read/write latency for performance tuning.
- **Resource Usage:**
  - Monitor memory and CPU usage of cache servers.
- **Alerts:**
  - Set up alerts for cache outages, high miss rates, or resource exhaustion.

---

## 8. Extensibility for Future Needs

- **Pluggable Backends:**
  - Design cache interfaces to support swapping or adding new cache layers (e.g., Memcached, cloud cache).
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Support for pub/sub, distributed locks, or cache-aside patterns as needs grow.
- **Scalability:**
  - Plan for horizontal scaling of distributed cache (sharding, clustering).
- **Observability:**
  - Integrate cache metrics with system-wide monitoring and dashboards.
