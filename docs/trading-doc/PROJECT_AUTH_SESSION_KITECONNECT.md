# Authentication & Session Management (KiteConnect, Personal Use)

This document describes the authentication and session management approach for a modular trading system designed for personal use, with KiteConnect as the authentication provider. All authentication is backend-only, with no public or frontend exposure.

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

- **Personal Use, Backend-Only:**
  - Authentication is required only for backend access to the KiteConnect API.
  - No user-facing login or public authentication endpoints are exposed.
- **Goal:**
  - Securely authenticate with KiteConnect, manage session state, and ensure uninterrupted trading automation.

## 2. KiteConnect OAuth Flow & Session Lifecycle

- **OAuth Flow:**
  - Use the official KiteConnect OAuth process to obtain an access token and refresh token.
  - The user completes the OAuth flow once to authorize the application.
- **Session Lifecycle:**
  - **Active:** Access token is valid and can be used for API calls.
  - **Expired:** Access token has expired; use the refresh token to obtain a new one.
  - **Revoked:** User revokes access or logs out; session is invalidated and must be re-authorized.
- **Session Renewal:**
  - Monitor token expiration and proactively refresh tokens before expiry.
  - Handle forced logouts or revocations by prompting for re-authorization.

---

## 3. Secure Storage & Refresh of Tokens

- **Storage:**
  - Store access and refresh tokens securely in the backend (database or encrypted config).
  - Never log or expose tokens in plaintext.
- **Refresh:**
  - Use the refresh token to obtain new access tokens as needed.
  - Implement retry logic and exponential backoff for transient errors.
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Use environment variables or a secrets manager for API keys and sensitive credentials.

---

## 4. Session State Management

- **Track Session State:**
  - Maintain a record of the current session (active, expired, revoked) in the backend.
  - Log all authentication events (login, refresh, logout, error).
- **Session Expiry Handling:**
  - Detect and handle token expiration gracefully (automatic refresh, alerting).
- **Revocation Handling:**
  - Detect when a session is revoked (e.g., via API error or webhook) and require re-authorization.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Authentication Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation:**
  - If authentication fails, pause trading actions and alert the operator.
- **Alerting:**
  - Send notifications (e.g., Telegram, email) on authentication failures or required re-authorization.
- **Audit Logging:**
  - Log all authentication attempts, errors, and session changes for troubleshooting and compliance.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance Considerations

- **No Public Exposure:**
  - Do not expose any authentication endpoints or tokens to the public or a frontend.
- **Access Control:**
  - Restrict backend access to trusted users and systems only.
- **Token Hygiene:**
  - Rotate tokens regularly and revoke unused or compromised tokens immediately.
- **Compliance:**
  - Retain logs of authentication events for auditability.

---

## 7. Extensibility for Additional Brokers

- **Modular Design:**
  - Abstract authentication/session logic to support additional brokers in the future.
  - Use a common interface for session management (e.g., login, refresh, logout).
- **Configuration:**
  - Allow switching or adding brokers via configuration, without code changes to core logic.
- **Testing:**
  - Use mocks or sandboxes for testing authentication flows without real accounts.

## 8. Summary

This approach ensures secure, reliable, and maintainable authentication and session management for personal-use trading automation with KiteConnect. All authentication is handled internally, with no public exposure, and the system is designed for easy extension to additional brokers in the future.
