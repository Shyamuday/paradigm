# Risk Management Design & Best Practices for Modular Trading System

This document provides a robust, language-agnostic blueprint for the Risk Management module of a modular trading system. It covers the module’s purpose, responsibilities, risk controls, data flow, extensibility, best practices, integration, and monitoring—**without code or implementation details**. Use this as a guide for designing a reliable, auditable, and maintainable risk management system in any tech stack.

---

## 1. Purpose & Role in the System

- **Risk Guardian:** The risk management module enforces trading rules and limits to protect capital and ensure compliance.
- **Gatekeeper:** Intercepts trade signals and position updates to approve, modify, or block actions based on risk criteria.
- **Alert Generator:** Notifies operators of risk breaches, violations, or abnormal conditions.

---

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Risk Rule Enforcement:** Apply pre-defined and configurable risk rules to all trades and positions.
- **Pre-Trade Checks:** Evaluate trade signals before order placement (position sizing, exposure, stop loss, etc.).
- **Post-Trade Monitoring:** Continuously monitor open positions and portfolio risk metrics.
- **Alerting:** Generate alerts for risk violations, breaches, or abnormal activity.
- **Audit Logging:** Record all risk decisions, violations, and actions for compliance and troubleshooting.

---

## 3. Types of Risk Controls

- **Position Sizing:** Limit trade size based on capital, risk per trade, or other criteria.
- **Stop Loss:** Enforce stop loss levels (fixed, percentage, ATR-based, trailing, etc.).
- **Take Profit:** Optionally enforce take profit levels.
- **Max Drawdown:** Limit maximum loss over a period (daily, weekly, total).
- **Exposure Limits:** Restrict total exposure by symbol, sector, or portfolio.
- **Leverage Limits:** Cap leverage used in trading.
- **Max Open Positions:** Limit the number of simultaneous open trades.
- **Daily Loss Limits:** Halt trading if daily loss exceeds a threshold.
- **Custom Rules:** Support for user-defined or strategy-specific risk checks.

---

## 4. Data Flow

- **Inputs:**
  - Trade signals from strategy engine
  - Position and portfolio data
  - Market data (for dynamic risk metrics)
  - Configuration and risk parameters
- **Outputs:**
  - Risk approvals/denials (to order management)
  - Alerts and notifications (to notification system)
  - Audit logs and risk reports
- **Event Triggers:**
  - On new trade signal (pre-trade check)
  - On position update (post-trade monitoring)
  - On market data event (dynamic risk metrics)

---

## 5. Extensibility for New Risk Rules & Metrics

- **Modular Rule Engine:**
  - Implement risk rules as independent, pluggable modules.
  - Allow enabling/disabling and configuring rules per user, strategy, or portfolio.
- **Custom Metrics:**
  - Support calculation and monitoring of custom risk metrics (e.g., VaR, Sharpe ratio).
- **Dynamic Configuration:**
  - Allow risk parameters to be updated at runtime or via config/database.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Reliability, Auditability, & Compliance

- **Atomic Checks:**
  - Ensure all risk checks are performed atomically before order placement.
- **Audit Trails:**
  - Log all risk decisions, violations, and parameter changes with timestamps and context.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults:**
  - Block or halt trading on system errors, missing data, or risk engine failures.
- **Compliance:**
  - Support regulatory requirements (e.g., data retention, reporting, user-level controls).
- **Testing:**
  - Unit and integration test all risk rules and edge cases.

---

## 7. Integration with Other Modules

- **Strategy Engine:**
  - Receives trade signals for pre-trade risk checks.
- **Order Management:**
  - Approves or blocks orders based on risk evaluation.
- **Notification System:**
  - Sends alerts for risk breaches, violations, or abnormal activity.
- **Database:**
  - Stores risk profiles, metrics, and audit logs.
- **Monitoring/Logging:**
  - Exposes risk metrics and health status for dashboards and alerting.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Alerting

- **Risk Metrics:**
  - Track and expose key risk metrics (drawdown, exposure, open positions, etc.).
- **Health Checks:**
  - Monitor risk engine status and alert on failures or degraded performance.
- **Alerting:**
  - Notify operators of risk violations, system errors, or parameter changes.

---

## 9. Summary

This design enables a robust, auditable, and maintainable risk management system for a modular trading platform. By following these principles, you can enforce a wide range of risk controls, ensure compliance, and protect capital in any trading environment.
