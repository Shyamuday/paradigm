# Node.js Tech Stack Blueprint for Modular Trading System (PostgreSQL Edition, Personal Use)

This document provides a Node.js-specific blueprint for implementing the modular trading system, with **PostgreSQL selected as the database**. It is **optimized for personal use and backend-only operation**—no API layer or frontend integration is required. Use this as a guide for a robust, production-grade Node.js implementation for your own use.

---

## 1. Database Layer (PostgreSQL)

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **Prisma**: Type-safe ORM for PostgreSQL
  - **pg**: Native PostgreSQL driver (used by Prisma)
- **Rationale:**
  - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, production-grade relational database.
  - Prisma provides a modern, type-safe, and developer-friendly ORM with migration support and excellent TypeScript integration for PostgreSQL.
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Use Prisma for all CRUD and transactional operations.
  - Use PostgreSQL features such as JSONB, full-text search, and advanced indexing as needed.

---

## 2. Caching Layer

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **ioredis**: Robust Redis client for Node.js (supports clustering, pub/sub, etc.)
  - **node-cache**: Simple in-memory cache for L1 caching
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Use multi-level caching: L1 (in-memory), L2 (Redis), L3 (PostgreSQL if needed).
  - Invalidate cache by key, tag, or TTL as appropriate.

---

## 3. Web/API Layer (**Optional/Skip for Personal Use**)

- **If you do not need to expose an API or integrate with a frontend, you can skip this section.**
- **If you want a local dashboard or CLI tools, see below.**
- **Packages (if ever needed):**
  - **express**, **cors**, **helmet**, **swagger-ui-express**, **express-validator**

---

## 4. Authentication & Session Management

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **jsonwebtoken**: JWT token creation and validation (if you want to secure CLI tools or local dashboards)
  - **express-session**: Session management (optional, if you ever add a local web UI)
- **Integration Advice:**
  - For personal use, you may not need authentication unless you want to restrict access to local dashboards or scripts.

---

## 5. Strategy Engine

- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Implement as a plug-in system (load strategies dynamically from a directory or config)
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for strategy contracts
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Use dependency injection for testability.
  - Store strategy configurations and results in PostgreSQL for auditability.

---

## 6. Order Management & Broker Integration

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **axios**: HTTP client for broker APIs
  - **ws**: WebSocket client for real-time broker data
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Abstract broker API calls behind a service interface.
  - Store all order and position data in PostgreSQL for consistency and reporting.

---

## 7. Risk Management

- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Implement as a service with configurable rules (use TypeScript for strict typing)
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Use event emitters or a pub/sub pattern for risk alerts.
  - Store risk profiles, metrics, and violations in PostgreSQL for compliance and analysis.

---

## 8. Notification System (with Telegram)

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **telegraf**: For building and sending messages with Telegram bots
- **Integration Steps:**
  1. Create a Telegram bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and obtain the bot token.
  2. Store the bot token and your target chat ID (user, group, or channel) in your environment variables or config.
  3. Add a Telegram adapter to your notification dispatcher/service.
  4. On notification events (trade executed, error, risk alert, etc.), format the message and send it to your Telegram chat/group using the bot.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Handle delivery errors (e.g., bot blocked, network issues) and log all notifications.
  - Use Markdown/HTML for message formatting if needed.
  - Keep your bot token secure and do not share it publicly.
  - Optionally, support multiple notification channels (email, Telegram, etc.) via a dispatcher pattern.

---

## 9. Monitoring & Logging

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **pino** or **winston**: Structured logging
  - **pino-pretty**: Dev-friendly log formatting
  - **@sentry/node**: Error monitoring (optional)
  - **prom-client**: Expose Prometheus metrics (optional)
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Centralize logging; expose `/metrics` and `/health` endpoints if you want local dashboards.
  - Store critical logs and metrics in PostgreSQL for long-term analysis if needed.

---

## 10. Testing

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **jest**: Unit/integration testing
  - **ts-jest**: TypeScript support for Jest
  - **supertest**: HTTP endpoint testing (optional, if you add a local API)
  - **eslint** + **prettier**: Linting and formatting
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Organize tests by module; use mocks for external dependencies.
  - Use PostgreSQL test databases for integration tests.

---

## 11. DevOps & Tooling

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **pm2**: Process manager for production
  - **nodemon**: Auto-reload in development
  - **concurrently**: Run multiple scripts in parallel
  - **cross-env**: Cross-platform env variable support
  - **husky** + **lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality
  - **typedoc**: Generate API docs from TypeScript
  - **dotenv**: Manage environment variables
  - **docker**: Containerization (Dockerfile, docker-compose)
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Use `.env` for config; automate builds, tests, and deploys with CI/CD.
  - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis containers.

---

## 12. Terminal Dashboard & CLI Tools (Recommended for Personal Use)

- **Recommended Packages:**
  - **blessed**, **blessed-contrib**: Terminal dashboards for real-time monitoring and control
  - **yargs** or **commander**: CLI tool creation for managing strategies, running reports, etc.
- **Integration Advice:**
  - Build dashboards for positions, P&L, and system status.
  - Use CLI tools for starting/stopping strategies, running backtests, or viewing logs.

---

## 13. Adapting the Architecture to Node.js with PostgreSQL (Personal Use)

- Use TypeScript for strict typing and maintainability.
- Leverage Node.js’s async/await for all I/O operations.
- Use event emitters or pub/sub for decoupled module communication.
- Organize code by feature/module, not by technical layer.
- Use dependency injection for testability and flexibility.
- Prefer stateless services for scalability; use Redis or PostgreSQL for shared state.
- Expose health and metrics endpoints for monitoring (optional).
- Use PostgreSQL for all persistent data, analytics, and reporting.
- Focus on local dashboards, CLI tools, and backend logic.

---

## 14. Node.js Best Practices

- Always handle async errors (try/catch, .catch for promises).
- Validate all external input (API, config, user data).
- Use environment variables for secrets/configuration.
- Log all critical actions and errors.
- Monitor resource usage and set up alerts.
- Keep dependencies up to date and audit regularly.
- Use process managers and containerization for production reliability.
- Use PostgreSQL features (transactions, indexing, JSONB, etc.) for performance and flexibility.
