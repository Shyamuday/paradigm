# Terminal Dashboard & CLI Tools Design for Modular Trading System

This document provides a robust, language-agnostic blueprint for the Terminal Dashboard & CLI Tools module of a modular trading system, optimized for personal use. It covers the purpose, responsibilities, recommended architecture, key features, best practices, extensibility, operational workflows, and integrationâ€”**without code or implementation details**. Use this as a guide for designing a powerful, user-friendly, and maintainable terminal interface for your trading platform.

## 1. Purpose & Role in the System

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provide live visibility into system status, trades, and alerts.
- **Direct Control:** Allow manual intervention, order entry, and strategy management.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Enable quick diagnostics, troubleshooting, and system management from the terminal.
- **Personalization:** Tailor the interface for individual workflows and preferences.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Status Display:** Show real-time data on system health, positions, orders, and strategies.
- **Command Execution:** Allow users to execute commands (start/stop strategies, place/cancel orders, view logs).
- **Interactive Prompts:** Support user input for configuration, authentication, or manual actions.
- **Notification Display:** Present alerts, errors, and important events in the terminal.
- **Log Access:** Provide access to recent logs and error messages for diagnostics.

## 3. Recommended Architecture

- **Modular CLI Design:**
  - Organize commands by module (order, strategy, risk, notification, etc.).
  - Use a command parser/dispatcher for extensibility.
- **Dashboard Layout:**
  - Use panels or sections for key metrics (orders, P&L, risk, logs, alerts).
  - Support both summary and detailed views.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Allow new commands and dashboard widgets to be added easily.
  - Support plugin or script-based extensions for custom workflows.
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Keep UI logic separate from business logic and data access.

## 4. Key Features

- **Live Status Panels:**
  - Show account balance, open positions, order book, and strategy status.
- **Manual Order Entry:**
  - Allow placing, modifying, and canceling orders directly from the CLI.
- **Strategy Control:**
  - Start, stop, or configure strategies interactively.
- **Real-Time Logs & Alerts:**
  - Stream logs and display alerts as they occur.
- **Notification Integration:**
  - Show Telegram or email notifications in the dashboard.
- **Custom Commands:**
  - Support user-defined scripts or macros for repetitive tasks.
- **Help & Documentation:**
  - Provide built-in help and usage instructions for all commands.

## 5. Best Practices for Usability, Security, & Maintainability

- **Clear UI/UX:**
  - Use color, formatting, and layout for clarity and quick recognition.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate all user inputs to prevent errors and misuse.
- **Access Control:**
  - Restrict sensitive commands to authorized users.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear error messages and recovery options.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document all commands, options, and workflows.
- **Modular Codebase:**
  - Keep CLI logic modular for easy updates and testing.

## 6. Extensibility for New Features & Modules

- **Plugin Architecture:**
  - Allow new modules or features to register their own commands and dashboard panels.
- **Configurable Shortcuts:**
  - Support user-defined shortcuts and macros.
- **Theming & Customization:**
  - Allow users to customize appearance and layout.

---

## 7. Operational Workflows

- **Startup:**
  - Initialize dashboard, load config, and connect to backend services.
- **Command Execution:**
  - Parse and execute user commands, display results or errors.
- **Live Updates:**
  - Refresh dashboard panels in real time as data changes.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Log errors, display alerts, and offer recovery actions.
- **Shutdown:**
  - Cleanly disconnect from services and save session state if needed.

---

## 8. Integration with Other Modules

- **Monitoring:**
  - Display health checks, metrics, and alerts from the monitoring module.
- **Notification:**
  - Show real-time notifications and allow sending manual alerts.
- **Order Management:**
  - Place, modify, and cancel orders via the CLI.
- **Strategy Engine:**
  - Start, stop, and configure strategies interactively.
- **Risk Management:**
  - Display risk metrics and allow manual overrides if permitted.
