# Web/API Layer Design for Personal Use (KiteConnect Integration)

This document describes the Web/API Layer for a modular trading system designed for personal use, where the only external API integration is with the default KiteConnect API. There is **no public REST API or frontend exposure**â€”all API interactions are backend-only and focused on trading automation and data ingestion.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

- **Personal Use Only:**
  - No public REST API or web frontend is exposed.
  - All API calls are made from the backend to external services (KiteConnect).
- **Primary Goal:**
  - Integrate with the KiteConnect API for market data, order management, and account information.

---

## 2. KiteConnect Integration as Primary External API

- **KiteConnect API:**
  - Official API for Zerodha trading platform.
  - Provides endpoints for authentication, market data, order placement, position tracking, and account management.
- **Integration Points:**
  - Market data (real-time and historical)
  - Order placement, modification, and cancellation
  - Position and holdings tracking
  - Account and margin information

---

## 3. Authentication & Session Management

- **KiteConnect OAuth Flow:**
  - Use the official OAuth flow to obtain access tokens for API calls.
  - Store and refresh tokens securely in the backend (database or encrypted config).
- **Session Handling:**
  - Maintain session state for the authenticated user/account.
  - Handle token expiration and automatic re-authentication as needed.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Never expose tokens or credentials to the frontend or public endpoints.
  - Use environment variables or a secrets manager for sensitive data.

## 4. Data Flow with KiteConnect

- **Market Data:**
  - Subscribe to real-time market data streams (WebSocket) for required instruments.
  - Fetch historical data for backtesting and analytics.
  - Cache frequently accessed data for performance.
- **Order Management:**
  - Place, modify, and cancel orders via KiteConnect REST endpoints.
  - Track order status and update positions accordingly.
- **Position & Account Tracking:**
  - Poll or subscribe to position and holdings updates.
  - Monitor account balance, margin, and risk metrics.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Handle API errors, rate limits, and disconnections gracefully.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Backend-Only KiteConnect Use

- **Session Security:**
  - Store tokens securely; never log or expose them.
  - Rotate and refresh tokens as required by KiteConnect.
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Respect KiteConnect API rate limits to avoid bans or throttling.
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- **Data Consistency:**
  - Reconcile local state (orders, positions) with KiteConnect regularly.
  - Use idempotent operations where possible.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Log all API interactions and errors for troubleshooting.
  - Set up alerts for authentication failures or API outages.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance

- **No Public Exposure:**
  - Do not expose any KiteConnect endpoints or data to the public or a frontend.
- **Access Control:**
  - Restrict backend access to trusted users and systems only.
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Use environment variables or a secrets manager for API keys and tokens.
- **Audit Logging:**
  - Log all critical API actions (order placement, authentication, etc.) for auditability.

---

## 7. Extensibility for Future Broker APIs

- **Modular API Integration:**
  - Design the API integration layer to support additional brokers in the future (plug-in architecture).
  - Abstract broker-specific logic behind a common interface (e.g., placeOrder, getMarketData).
- **Configuration:**
  - Allow switching or adding brokers via configuration, without code changes to core logic.
- **Testing:**
  - Use mocks or sandboxes for testing broker integrations without real trades.

---

## 8. Summary

This design enables a secure, maintainable, and extensible backend-only trading system using KiteConnect as the default and only external API. All API interactions are handled internally, with no public exposure, ensuring safety and compliance for personal trading automation.
