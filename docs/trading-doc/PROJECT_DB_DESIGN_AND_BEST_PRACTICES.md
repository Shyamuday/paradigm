# Database Design & Best Practices for Modular Trading System

This document provides a robust, language-agnostic guide to database design and operational best practices for a modular trading system. It covers core entities, schema principles, data integrity, security, performance, and extensibilityâ€”**without code or SQL**. Use this as a blueprint for implementing a reliable, scalable, and maintainable database layer in any RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL).

## 1. Core Entities & Relationships

### **A. User & Session Management**

- **User**: Stores authentication credentials, profile info, and preferences.
- **Session**: Tracks active sessions, tokens, and expiration for each user.
- **Relationships:** One user can have many sessions.

### **B. Trading Entities**

- **Trade**: Represents an executed order (action, symbol, quantity, price, status, timestamps).
- **Position**: Tracks open/closed positions, P&L, entry/exit, and risk parameters.
- **Instrument**: Market instrument details (symbol, exchange, type, lot size, tick size, etc.).
- **Strategy**: Configuration and metadata for each trading strategy.
- **Relationships:**
  - One user/session can have many trades and positions.
  - Each trade/position is linked to an instrument and (optionally) a strategy.

### **C. Risk & Compliance**

- **RiskProfile**: User- or account-specific risk parameters (limits, thresholds).
- **RiskMetrics**: Daily/periodic risk statistics (drawdown, VaR, win rate, etc.).
- **Relationships:** One user can have one or more risk profiles and many risk metrics records.

### **D. Market Data**

- **MarketData**: Stores real-time and historical price/volume data.
- **CandleData**: Aggregated OHLCV data for timeframes.
- **VolumeProfile**: Price/volume distribution for analysis.
- **Relationships:** Linked to instruments and timeframes.

### **E. Notification & Logging**

- **Notification**: Records sent alerts (type, channel, status, timestamp).
- **SystemLog**: Centralized log of system events, errors, and actions.
- **Relationships:** Notifications and logs can be linked to users, trades, or system events.

## 2. Schema Design Principles

- **Normalization:**
  - Use 3NF or higher to avoid data duplication and ensure consistency.
  - Separate reference data (instruments, strategies) from transactional data (trades, positions).
- **Indexing:**
  - Index frequently queried columns (user ID, session token, trade status, timestamps).
  - Use composite indexes for multi-column queries (e.g., user+session, instrument+timestamp).
- **Constraints:**
  - Use primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to enforce relationships and data integrity.
  - Use check constraints for value ranges (e.g., status enums, positive quantities).
- **Timestamps:**
  - Store created/updated timestamps for all transactional entities.
- **Soft Deletes:**
  - Use a `deleted_at` column for soft deletes if you need to retain historical data.

## 3. Data Integrity & Transactional Best Practices

- **Atomicity:**
  - Use transactions for multi-step operations (e.g., trade execution + position update).
- **Consistency:**
  - Enforce referential integrity with foreign keys.
- **Isolation:**
  - Use appropriate isolation levels to prevent race conditions (e.g., serializable for critical updates).
- **Durability:**
  - Ensure all committed transactions are persisted (use WAL/logging features).
- **Validation:**
  - Validate all data at the application and database level.

---

## 4. Backup & Disaster Recovery

- **Automated Backups:**
  - Schedule regular full and incremental backups of the database.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:**
  - Enable WAL/archive logging for point-in-time restores.
- **Offsite Storage:**
  - Store backups in a secure, geographically separate location (cloud, S3, etc.).
- **Restore Drills:**
  - Regularly test backup restores to ensure reliability.
- **Retention Policy:**
  - Define how long to keep backups and when to purge old data.

---

## 5. Security

- **Encryption:**
  - Encrypt data at rest (disk-level or DB-native encryption).
  - Use SSL/TLS for all connections to the database.
- **Access Control:**
  - Use least-privilege principles for DB users/roles.
  - Separate application, admin, and reporting users.
- **Auditing:**
  - Log all access to sensitive tables (users, trades, risk profiles).
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Store DB credentials in environment variables or a secrets manager.

---

## 6. Performance Optimization

- **Partitioning:**
  - Partition large tables (e.g., market data, logs) by date or instrument for faster queries and easier archiving.
- **Query Tuning:**
  - Analyze and optimize slow queries (use EXPLAIN, query logs).
- **Caching:**
  - Use Redis or in-memory caches for frequently accessed, non-critical data.
- **Batch Processing:**
  - Use batch inserts/updates for high-volume data (e.g., historical imports).
- **Archiving:**
  - Move old data to archive tables or external storage to keep operational tables fast.

---

## 7. Auditability & Compliance

- **Audit Trails:**
  - Record all critical actions (trade execution, config changes, logins) with user, timestamp, and before/after state.
- **Data Retention:**
  - Define and enforce policies for how long to keep different types of data.
- **Compliance:**
  - Support for GDPR, SOC2, or other relevant standards as needed.
- **Reporting:**
  - Design schema to support regulatory and internal reporting requirements.

---

## 8. Extensibility for Future Features

- **Modular Schema:**
  - Design tables so new features (e.g., new strategy types, notification channels, analytics) can be added without major refactoring.
- **Reference Tables:**
  - Use lookup/reference tables for enums, status codes, and configuration.
- **Versioning:**
  - Add version columns to strategies, configs, or risk profiles to support upgrades and migrations.
- **Event Sourcing (optional):**
  - For advanced auditability, consider event sourcing for trades, positions, and risk events.
