# Strategy Engine Design & Best Practices for Modular Trading System

This document provides a robust, language-agnostic blueprint for the Strategy Engine module of a modular trading system. It covers the engine’s purpose, responsibilities, plug-in architecture, lifecycle, data flow, extensibility, best practices, monitoring, and auditability—**without code or implementation details**. Use this as a guide for designing a flexible, testable, and maintainable strategy engine in any tech stack.

## 1. Purpose & Role in the System

- **Central Brain:** The strategy engine is responsible for running trading strategies that analyze market data and generate trade signals.
- **Plug-in Host:** Supports multiple, independently developed strategies as plug-ins.
- **Orchestrator:** Coordinates the flow of data from market feeds to strategy logic and onward to order management and risk modules.

---

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Strategy Loading:** Discover and load strategies dynamically from a directory, config, or registry.
- **Configuration:** Apply user- or system-defined parameters to each strategy instance.
- **Execution:** Run strategy logic on new market data or scheduled intervals.
- **Signal Dispatch:** Emit trade signals for downstream processing (risk, order, notification).
- **Lifecycle Management:** Start, stop, reload, and monitor strategies as needed.
- **Status Reporting:** Expose health, status, and performance metrics for each strategy.

---

## 3. Plug-in Architecture for Strategies

- **Plug-in Model:**
  - Strategies are independent modules that implement a common interface (e.g., `init`, `onData`, `onSignal`, `shutdown`).
  - The engine loads strategies at runtime, allowing for hot-swapping and upgrades without system downtime.
- **Isolation:**
  - Each strategy runs in its own context to prevent side effects and enable independent testing.
- **Registration:**
  - Strategies are registered via configuration or discovered automatically from a plug-in directory.
- **Extensibility:**
  - New strategies can be added without modifying the engine core.

---

## 4. Strategy Lifecycle

- **Initialization:**
  - Load strategy code and configuration.
  - Validate parameters and dependencies.
- **Running:**
  - Receive market data events or scheduled triggers.
  - Execute strategy logic and maintain internal state.
- **Signal Generation:**
  - When conditions are met, emit trade signals (buy, sell, hold, etc.).
- **Stopping/Reloading:**
  - Gracefully stop or reload strategies for updates or maintenance.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Catch and log all exceptions; isolate failures to individual strategies.

---

## 5. Data Flow

- **Inputs:**
  - Real-time or historical market data (ticks, candles, order book, etc.)
  - Configuration parameters (periods, thresholds, risk limits)
  - Optional: User commands or external signals
- **Outputs:**
  - Trade signals (action, symbol, quantity, confidence, metadata)
  - Status updates, logs, and performance metrics
- **Flow:**
  1. Market data/event arrives
  2. Engine dispatches data to all enabled strategies
  3. Each strategy processes data and may emit signals
  4. Signals are routed to risk/order/notification modules

---

## 6. Extensibility for New Strategy Types

- **Strategy Interface:**
  - Define a clear contract for all strategies (required methods, expected inputs/outputs).
- **Parameterization:**
  - Support custom parameters for each strategy instance.
- **Multiple Types:**
  - Support for different strategy paradigms (trend following, mean reversion, options, ML-based, etc.).
- **Backtesting:**
  - Allow strategies to run in both live and backtest modes with the same interface.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **Testability:**
  - Isolate strategy logic for unit and integration testing.
  - Use dependency injection for data sources and services.
- **Configuration:**
  - Store strategy parameters in config files or a database for easy tuning.
- **Versioning:**
  - Track strategy versions and parameter changes for auditability.
- **Documentation:**
  - Require documentation for each strategy’s logic, parameters, and expected behavior.
- **Performance:**
  - Monitor execution time and resource usage for each strategy.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Error Handling

- **Health Checks:**
  - Expose health/status endpoints or metrics for each strategy.
- **Logging:**
  - Log all signals, errors, and key events with timestamps and context.
- **Alerting:**
  - Notify operators of strategy failures, missed signals, or abnormal behavior.
- **Isolation:**
  - Ensure that a failure in one strategy does not impact others or the engine core.

---

## 9. Versioning & Auditability

- **Version Control:**
  - Track code and configuration versions for each strategy.
- **Audit Logs:**
  - Record all strategy actions, signals, and parameter changes with timestamps and user/context info.
- **Reproducibility:**
  - Enable replay of historical data for backtesting and debugging.

## 10. Summary

This design enables a flexible, extensible, and maintainable strategy engine for a modular trading system. By following these principles, you can support a wide range of trading strategies, ensure robust operation, and enable rapid innovation and testing.
