### Strategy Engine

- **Purpose:** Load, configure, and execute trading strategies.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Discover/load strategies (plug-in architecture)
  - Execute strategy logic on new data
  - Emit trade signals
- **Logic Flow:**
  1. On new market data, run all enabled strategies
  2. Each strategy analyzes data, may emit trade signals
  3. Dispatch signals to risk/order management
- **Extensibility:** Plug-in for custom strategies, support for multiple strategy types.
- **Best Practices:** Isolate strategy logic, allow runtime enable/disable.

### Order Management
