# Full Project Blueprint: Modular Trading System

This document provides a comprehensive, language-agnostic description of a modular, service-oriented trading system. It is intended as a blueprint for implementation in any language or tech stack.

## 1. **High-Level Architecture & Design Philosophy**

- **Modular & Service-Oriented:** Each major feature is encapsulated in its own module or service, with clear boundaries and interfaces.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic, data access, middleware, and UI are separated for maintainability and testability.
- **Event-Driven:** Modules communicate via events or messages, enabling decoupling and extensibility.
- **Plug-in Ready:** Strategies, data sources, and notification channels can be added or replaced without changing core logic.
- **Testable & Observable:** All modules are designed for unit/integration testing and real-time monitoring.

### **D. Caching Layer**

- **Purpose:** Provide fast access to frequently used data, support multi-level cache.
- **Key Components:** L1/L2/L3 Cache Stores, Invalidation Engine.
- **Data Flow:** Receives data to cache → stores/retrieves data → invalidates as needed.
- **Extensibility:** Add new cache backends or custom invalidation strategies.

### **E. Market Data Integration**

- **Purpose:** Connect to external data providers, normalize and broadcast data.
- **Key Components:** Data Connectors, Normalizer, Broadcaster.
- **Data Flow:** Receives raw data → normalizes → emits events to subscribers.
- **Extensibility:** Add new data sources or custom normalization logic.

### **F. Strategy Engine**

- **Purpose:** Load, configure, and execute trading strategies.
- **Key Components:** Strategy Loader, Executor, Signal Dispatcher.
- **Data Flow:** Receives market data/events → runs strategies → emits trade signals.
- **Extensibility:** Plug-in architecture for custom strategies.

### **G. Order Management**

- **Purpose:** Place and track orders, update positions, calculate P&L.
- **Key Components:** Order Router, Tracker, Position Updater.
- **Data Flow:** Receives trade signals → places orders → tracks status → updates positions.
- **Extensibility:** Support for multiple brokers/exchanges.

### **H. Risk Management**

- **Purpose:** Enforce risk rules, perform risk checks, generate alerts.
- **Key Components:** Rule Engine, Monitor, Alert Generator.
- **Data Flow:** Receives trade signals/positions → evaluates risk → approves/denies or triggers alerts.
- **Extensibility:** Add new risk rules or custom alerting logic.

### **I. Notification System**

- **Purpose:** Send notifications via multiple channels, support templated messages.
- **Key Components:** Channel Adapters, Template Engine, Dispatcher.
- **Data Flow:** Receives events → formats messages → sends via channels.
- **Extensibility:** Add new notification channels or templates.

### **J. Monitoring & Logging**

- **Purpose:** Centralized logging, metrics collection, health checks.
- **Key Components:** Logger, Metrics Collector, Health Checker.
- **Data Flow:** Receives log/metric events → stores/exports data → exposes health endpoints.
- **Extensibility:** Integrate with external monitoring/alerting systems.

### **K. API Layer (Optional)**

- **Purpose:** Expose endpoints for external integration, handle auth, rate limiting, validation.
- **Key Components:** API Router, Auth Middleware, Rate Limiter, Input Validator.
- **Data Flow:** Receives API requests → routes to services → returns responses.
- **Extensibility:** Add new endpoints or protocols (REST/gRPC/WebSocket).

### **L. User Interface (Optional)**

- **Purpose:** Provide dashboards for monitoring, control, analytics.
- **Key Components:** Dashboard Renderer, Data Updater, User Controls.
- **Data Flow:** Receives system/user events → updates UI → handles user actions.
- **Extensibility:** Add new views, controls, or real-time features.

## 3. **End-to-End Logic Flow**

1. **Startup:**

   - Load configuration, initialize all modules (DB, cache, logger, etc.).
   - Authenticate with external APIs (broker, data provider).
   - Start background jobs (data polling, health checks).

2. **Market Data Handling:**

   - Receive and normalize real-time/historical data.
   - Emit events to strategy engine and cache.

3. **Strategy Execution:**

   - On new data, run all enabled strategies.
   - Each strategy analyzes data and may emit trade signals.

4. **Order Lifecycle:**

   - Risk management checks each signal.
   - If approved, order management places the order.
   - Track order status, update positions, recalculate P&L.

5. **Risk & Compliance:**

   - Continuously monitor positions and trades for risk violations.
   - Trigger alerts and auto-close positions if needed.

6. **Notification & Monitoring:**

   - Send notifications for key events (trade executed, risk breach, error).
   - Log all actions and errors.
   - Expose metrics and health endpoints for monitoring.

7. **Shutdown:**
   - Gracefully close connections, persist state, notify users, log shutdown reason.

## 4. **Example Data Flows & Event Chains**

- **Market Data → Strategy Engine → Trade Signal → Risk Management → Order Management → Position Update**
- **User/API Request → Auth → Service → Response**
- **System Event → Notification System → User/Operator**

---

## 5. **Extensibility & Best Practices**

- **Plug-in Architecture:** Add/replace strategies, data sources, notification channels without changing core logic.
- **Dependency Injection:** Design modules for easy mocking/replacement in tests or new environments.
- **Event-Driven Design:** Use events for decoupling modules and enabling flexible workflows.
- **Strict Typing/Interfaces:** Define clear contracts for all module boundaries.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all modules.
- **Documentation:** Document all public APIs and extension points.

---

## 6. **Testing & Operational Considerations**

- **Unit Tests:** For all core logic in each module.
- **Integration Tests:** For workflows spanning multiple modules.
- **End-to-End Tests:** For full system validation.
- **Health Checks:** For all critical services.
- **Automated Migrations:** For database schema changes.
- **Containerization:** For consistent deployment.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrate with external systems for production observability.

---

## 7. **Deployment & Scaling Strategies**

- **Containerization:** Use Docker or similar for consistent, portable deployments.
- **Environment-Based Config:** Support for dev, staging, prod environments.
- **Automated Migrations:** Run DB migrations on deploy.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless services, distributed cache, and message queues for scale-out.
- **Process Management:** Use tools like PM2 for production process management.
- **CI/CD:** Automate build, test, and deploy pipelines.
